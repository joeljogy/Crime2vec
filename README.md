# Crime2vec
Crime data from San Francisco Police Dept. was first converted into vector representation space and with the help of word2vec, we use it to predict future crimes. In the suggested Crime2Vec model, we represent the point of time as word and the location as context. Also, we deal with the whole crimes during the year as text corpus.
